## Project Title: Stock and Revenue Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebook

### Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on extracting and analyzing historical stock and revenue data for Apple and Gamestop. Leveraging Python web scraping techniques, Beautiful Soup, and the yfinance API, the notebook provides a analysis of the financial performance of these companies.

### Key Features
* Data Extraction: Utilizes Python web scraping techniques and the yfinance API within a Jupyter Notebook environment to gather historical stock and revenue data for Apple and Gamestop.

* Data Cleaning: Ensures data quality by removing punctuation, handling null values, and eliminating empty strings directly within the notebook, preparing the dataset for analysis.

* Data Visualization: Displays the processed data through interactive graphs directly within the Jupyter Notebook, offering a visual representation of historical trends in stock and revenue.

### Technologies Used
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
* Beautiful Soup (version 4.10.0): Employed for web scraping to extract revenue data.
* yfinance (version 0.1.67): Used for extracting historical stock data.
* nbformat (version 5.9.2): Required for Jupyter Notebook compatibility.
* pandas library: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
* requests library: Involved in making HTTP requests for web scraping.
* plotly.graph_objects: Utilized for creating interactive graphs.
* plotly.subplots: Used to create subplots in the visualization.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run each cell to extract, clean, and visualize the data.
3. Explore the interactive graphs within the notebook to gain insights into the historical performance of Apple and Gamestop.
   * Note that the plotly graphs will not display in the GitHub preview of the Jupyter notebook, they will only display if you download and run the file. See graph files for an image of the graphs rendered from the notebook.
